# Adventure-Game
This is a simple game for a better understanding in Object-Oriented Programming in Java.


Important Rules: When player exits the location the left location's set player variable should be set to null (Fot the onLocation() method in the Location class.).

--note to myself
Also the battle locations battleLoc(Enemy e ) method doesnt need to have an enemy object as an argument it may have string as a parameter instead according to my implementation.
